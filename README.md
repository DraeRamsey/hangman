# Hangman
Hangman game made with JavaScript.
https://draeramsey.github.io/hangman/

I originally made this game as a class assignment.

The original product was done with Bootstrap and jQuery. Nothing against either of those I just wanted to redo the assignment with vanilla JavaScript and my own styles to get some better front-end practice in.

The hangman images were created using AdobeXD and the background image is from pixabay.com

With a look so clean and serene you almost forget the subject matter of the game.
